## Project Architecture

This project differs from the classic mvc pattern and includes more divisions
that in it`s turn, are more specific

    |- src    # here goes the whole development code
        |--- controllers        # responsible for recieving the request and returning the response
        |--- database           # contains database specifications
            |--- entities       # classes that represents the "shape" of the database stored data
            |--- migrations     # contains the database "version control" files
            |--- index.ts       # database connection

        |--- errors             # contain the custom error classes
        |--- repositories       # responsible for interacting directly with the database details
        |--- services           # responsible for all the business rule of the application
        |--- routes             # responsible for defining which classes have to deal with a request
        |--- server.ts          # the entry point of the system

## Design Patterns

Here is possible to find two famous design patterns, which are the service pattern and
the repository pattern.

**Service Pattern**: We create classes the contain all of the business rule involved
on a task, which makes easier to implement new ones or maintain the current rules.
They have only one method (execute) and must not know about any kind of specification
details of other layers.

**Repository Pattern**: We create classes that have the only purpouse of interacting
(store, delete, list, ...) with the database and it's implementation details. Every time we
want to execute some query on our database, we should do it using repositories, so we can
know exactly where to look for an error involving the database or where to include new
similar features.

## Application flow

At each request that is made to the api, this steps are followed

## Routes

*Note: each of of this routes is preceeded by a baseURL, in this case it is http://localhost:3333*

## Technologies

<details>
<summary>NodeJS</summary>
<br>
This is the JavaScript asynchronous environment that allows us to create backend
applications using js. It has a really good perfomance and it`s easy to use.
</details>

<details>
<summary>TypeScript</summary>
<br>
One of the most famous JS supersets. TypeScript allows us to have much more control
of our development environment since we can define interfaces and types for the abstractions
used on our code, so we can know exactly all the params, properties or attributes of such elements.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Express</summary>
<br>
Express is a microframework that allows us to create web servers and defining it's routes
and middlewares in an really easy and fast way. Beside, it can be intregrated with a lot of
plugins and features that include security, validation, file upload and much more.

an example of a working web server created on express:

```js
  import express from 'express';

  const app = express();
  const port = 3333;

  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log("I'm working!");
  })
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>TypeORM</summary>
<br>
It is responsible for the database management in the app. Since it is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) it is used to interact with the db implementations using abstractions and not query language.
TypeORM can make complex queries and relations look easier to understand and execute. However it's
trade-off is a performance loss, since it generates the queries by itself, which can be avoided
using the query builder integrated on it. That way we have more control of our queries.

storing a user on db via typeorm:

```js
  import { getRepository } from 'typeorm';
  import User from '../models/User';

  const repository = getRepository(User);

  const userData = {
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'johndoe@email.com',
  }

  repository.create(userData)
    .then(user => repository.save(user));
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>date-fns</summary>
<br>
date-fns is a js library for date-related operations. It has a set of usefull functions
for manipulating Date objects.
</details>

## How to run?

**make sure you have a postgres database running on port 5432 (default) and create a database called "cast_challenge". Beside, you must insert you database credentials on the ormconfig.json file**

if you use docker, you can find the postgres docker image right [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)

then, just navigate to the **backend** folder and execute those commands:

```bash
# download the dependencies
yarn

# run the api
yarn dev:server
```
